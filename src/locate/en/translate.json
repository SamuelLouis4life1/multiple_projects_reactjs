The concept of component composition comes into play for better code organization and reusability. Higher-Order Components (HOCs) become a tool to abstract and share component logic across the application. Proficiency in making asynchronous API calls, error handling strategies, and testing practices with libraries like Jest and React Testing Library further solidify one's skills.",

The initiation into React involves understanding fundamental concepts such as components, JSX, and the management of state and props. Building a basic React project and comprehending the component lifecycle are key milestones at this stage. Additionally, mastering basic event handling and navigation using React Router becomes imperative for crafting interactive and navigable applications.",
